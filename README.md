# Overview

I wrote this program to practice Java which is a new language to me. I worked to apply principles I have used in other coding languages to this Java program. 

This program is a basic text based rpg with 1-2 possible encounters with outcomes depending on what options were picked during character design. Currently the choices are limited, but I tried to design the program to be easily built upon. 

The purpose of writing this software is to get some practice with the java language and to recall some of the language principles I have used in other coding languages.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
