# Overview

I wrote this program to practice Java which is a new language to me. I worked to apply principles I have used in other coding languages to this Java program. 

This program is a basic text based rpg with 1-2 possible encounters with outcomes depending on what options were picked during character design. Currently the choices are limited, but I tried to design the program to be easily built upon. 

The purpose of writing this software is to get some practice with the java language and to recall some of the language principles I have used in other coding languages.

# Development Environment

The dev environment consisted of VSCode with Oracle's JDK and microsoft's recommended extension pack for java development.

The Java language was used in the program.
ArrayList and List from the Java Utils library were used.
